Lesson 5
========================================================

### Multivariate Data
Notes:
earlier we worked on single variable and two variable data. Now we are going on multi variable data
***

### Moira Perceived Audience Size Colored by Age
Notes: 
People are not good at guessing but maybe people who are elder in age may  have good approximation of their audience size. wecannot tell whether younger people were more accurate than elder people.
***

### Third Qualitative Variable
Notes:

```{r Third Qualitative Variable}
pf <- read.csv('pseudo_facebook.tsv',sep='\t')

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = age),
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender))) + geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom='point',shape=4)

ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count),
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender))) + geom_line(aes(color=gender),stat='summary', fun.y=median)

library(dplyr)
pf.age_and_gender <- group_by(pf,age,gender)
pf.fc_by_age_gender <- summarise(pf.age_and_gender, 
mean_friend_count = mean(friend_count), 
median_friend_count = median(friend_count),
n=n())
head(pf.fc_by_age_gender)
```

***

### Plotting Conditional Summaries
Notes:

```{r Plotting Conditional Summaries}
ggplot(aes(x=age,y=median_friend_count), data=pf.fc_by_age_gender)+geom_line(aes(color=gender))
```

***

### Thinking in Ratios
Notes:
helpful in understanding how the difference between amke and female users varies with age. gender diff is larger for younger users.

how many times female users have friends compared to male users
***

### Wide and Long Format
Notes:
data is in long format. convert it to wide format.use reshape package in R for moving between formats of data
***

### Reshaping Data
Notes:

```{r}
install.packages('reshape2')
library(reshape2)

pf.fc_by_age_gender.wide <- dcast(pf.fc_by_age_gender, age~gender, value.var='median_friend_count')
```


***

### Ratio Plot
Notes: median frmale user has 2.5 times friend than median male user

```{r Ratio Plot}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(aes(x=age,y=female/male), data=pf.fc_by_age_gender.wide)+geom_line()+geom_hline(yintercept=1,alpha=0.3)
```

***

### Third Quantitative Variable
Notes: facebook tenure is important to register friend count

```{r Third Quantitative Variable}
pf$year_joined <- floor(2014-pf$tenure/365)
```

***

### Cut a Variable
Notes:

```{r Cut a Variable}

summary(pf$year_joined)
table(pf$year_joined)

pf$year_joined.bucket <- cut(pf$year_joined, c(2004,2009,2011,2012,2014))
```

***

### Plotting it All Together
Notes:

```{r Plotting it All Together}
table(pf$year_joined.bucket, useNA = 'ifany')

ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count),
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(year_joined.bucket))) + geom_line(aes(color=year_joined.bucket),stat='summary', fun.y=median)


```

***

### Plot the Grand Mean
Notes:

```{r Plot the Grand Mean}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count),
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(year_joined.bucket))) + geom_line(aes(color=year_joined.bucket),stat='summary', fun.y=mean) +
  geom_line(stat='summary', fun.y=mean, linetype=2)
```

***

### Friending Rate
Notes:

```{r Friending Rate}
with(subset(pf, tenure>=1), summary(friend_count/tenure))
```

***

### Friendships Initiated
Notes:

What is the median friend rate?
0.22
What is the maximum friend rate?
417
```{r Friendships Initiated}
ggplot(aes(x = tenure, y = friendships_initiated/tenure),data = subset(pf, tenure>=1)) + geom_line(aes(color=year_joined.bucket),stat='summary', fun.y=mean)
```

***

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff Revisited
Notes:

```{r Bias-Variance Tradeoff Revisited}

ggplot(aes(x = tenure, y = friendships_initiated / tenure),
       data = subset(pf, tenure >= 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket),
            stat = 'summary',
            fun.y = mean)

ggplot(aes(x = 7 * round(tenure / 7), y = friendships_initiated / tenure),
       data = subset(pf, tenure > 0)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket),
            stat = "summary",
            fun.y = mean)

ggplot(aes(x = 30 * round(tenure / 30), y = friendships_initiated / tenure),
       data = subset(pf, tenure > 0)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket),
            stat = "summary",
            fun.y = mean)

ggplot(aes(x = 90 * round(tenure / 90), y = friendships_initiated / tenure),
       data = subset(pf, tenure > 0)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket),
            stat = "summary",
            fun.y = mean)

ggplot(aes(x = 90 * round(tenure / 90), y = friendships_initiated / tenure),
       data = subset(pf, tenure > 0)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = year_joined.bucket))

```

### Sean's NFL Fan Sentiment Study
Notes:
emotions of facebook friend. ratios of different emotions. moving average of all the ratios.
***

### Introducing the Yogurt Data Set
Notes:

***

### Histograms Revisited
Notes:
this dataset has many rows for each household. its kind of microdata

```{r Histograms Revisited}
yo <- read.csv('yogurt.csv')
str(yo)

yo$id <- factor(yo$id)
str(yo)

qplot(data=yo, x=price)
```

***

### Number of Purchases
Notes:

```{r Number of Purchases}
summary(yo)
table(unique(yo$price))

yo <- transform(yo, all.purchases = strawberry + 
                             blueberry + 
                             pina.colada + 
                             plain +
                             mixed.berry)

yo$all.purchases <- 
    yo$strawberry + 
    yo$blueberry +
    yo$pina.colada +
    yo$plain +
    yo$mixed.berry
```

***

### Prices over Time
Notes:

```{r Prices over Time}
qplot(x=yo$all.puchases, data=yo, binwidth=1)
```

***

### Sampling Observations
Notes:
when multile variables data is present for same unit, it is useful to work on sample of those datasets. We may want to look small set of household
***

### Looking at Samples of Households

```{r Looking at Sample of Households}
set.seed(4230)
sample.ids <- sample(levels(yo$id),16)

ggplot(aes(x=time, y=price),
       data=subset(yo,id%in%sample,ids))+
  facet_wrap(~id)+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(aes(size=all.puchases),pch=1)
```

***

### The Limits of Cross Sectional Data
Notes:
characteristics of individuals only and not the complete view
***

### Many Variables
Notes:
we relied on domain knowledge for selecting the third variable. use visualizationt to select the variables i.e. use many plots and graphs to explore
***

### Scatterplot Matrix
Notes:
used to create a number of scatter plots automatically. grid of scatter plots. not suited for categorical variables.
***
```{r}
install.packages('GGally')
library(GGally)
theme_set(theme_minimal(20))

set.seed(1836)
pf_subset <- pf[,c(2:15)]
names(pf$subset)
ggpairs(pf_subset[sample.int(nrow(pf_subset),1000),])
```

### Even More Variables
Notes:

***

### Heat Maps
Notes:

```{r}
nci <- read.table("nci.tsv")
colnames(nci) <- c(1:64)
```

```{r}
nci.long.samp <- melt(as.matrix(nci[1:200,]))
names(nci.long.samp) <- c("gene", "case", "value")
head(nci.long.samp)

ggplot(aes(y = gene, x = case, fill = value),
  data = nci.long.samp) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = colorRampPalette(c("blue", "red"))(100))
```


***

### Analyzing Three of More Variables
Reflection:
plots of conditional summaried, scatter plot matrix, heatmaps, long and wide format , reshape data
